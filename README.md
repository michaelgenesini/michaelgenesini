Hi there 🙏🏿 

I'm a software engineer passionate about component systems and automated tools but mostly I love 🍕.

Currently, I’m working with `TypeScript`, `JavaScript`, `React`, `React Native` and `Styled Components`.

Besides that, I'm trying to bring kindness to tech ❤️

You can connect with me on https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelgenesini/ 👐🏾
